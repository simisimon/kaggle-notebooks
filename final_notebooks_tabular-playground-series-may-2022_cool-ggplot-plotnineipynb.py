# 
# The Grammar of Graphics
# 
# "The grammar of graphics is a way of thinking about how graphs are constructed that allows data analysts to move beyond thinking about a small number of graph types (like bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, etc)."
# 
# "Think about the grammar of graphics just like you would about the grammar of sentence structure in language. Think beyond understanding language as just sentence types, like declarative sentences (statements of fact), imperative sentences (statement of request), or exclamatory sentences (statements of excitement/emotion)."
# 
# https://murraylax.org/rtutorials/gog.html
# 
# "Statistical graphics is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars)"
# 
# "These are basic building blocks according to the Grammar of Graphics:"
# 
# "data The data + a set of aesthetic mappings that describing variables mapping"
# 
# "geom Geometric objects, represent what you actually see on the plot: points, lines, polygons, etc."
# 
# "stats Statistical transformations, summarise data in many useful ways."
# 
# "scale The scales map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space"
# 
# "coord A coordinate system, describes how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphic."
# 
# "facet A faceting specification describes how to break up the data into subsets for plotting individual set"
# 
# https://monashdatafluency.github.io/python-workshop-base/modules/plotting_with_ggplot/
# 
# 
# Without any of these three components, plotnine wouldnâ€™t know how to draw the graphic: Data
# Aesthetics, Geometric objects.
# 
# "Data is the information to use when creating the plot."
# 
# "Aesthetics (aes) provides a mapping between data variables and aesthetic, or graphical, variables used by the underlying drawing system. In the previous section, you mapped the date and pop data variables to the x- and y-axis aesthetic variables."
# 
# "Geometric objects (geoms) defines the type of geometric object to use in the drawing. You can use points, lines, bars, and many others."

# #The Grammar of Graphics. 
# 
# By Thomas de Beus
# 
# "This Grammar of Graphics framework is built by statistician and computer scientist Leland Wilkinson. Its popularity got an enormous boost when Hadley Wickham created the immense popular package ggplot2 within the statistical programming language R. This package is based on the Grammar of Graphics, and the code you write follows its layers."
